# responsivePortfolio
This project was definitely much more of a challenge. I initially started the project before reading more about bootstrap and made some styling mistakes that 
took time to correct. Using certain premade sections such as a navbar from bootstrap made it much easier to get the layout looking good quickly. Further editing
these parts was a fun challenge to find the correct piece you were looking for using specific classes. 

Overall I think that this project pushed me to learn a lot more about html, css, and bootstrap. I believe I accomplished a home page for myself that shows information
about who I am. Then there are the required functional links that can take the user to my portfolio or contact page. The 3 pages are also responsive to changes in resolutions althought that was one of the biggest challenges to get right. Still not perfect by any means but I learned a lot while struggling with it. Overall I think it will serve at the least as a nice template for an improved version in the future.
